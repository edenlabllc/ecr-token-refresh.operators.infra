# ecr token refresh operator
The `ecr token refresh` operator refreshes automatically the Amazon ECR authorization token before it expires.

## Description
Amazon Elastic Container Registry [Private Registry Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry_auth.html) provides a temporary authorization token valid only for 12 hours. 
This operator refreshes automatically the Amazon ECR authorization token before it expires, reducing the overhead in managing the authentication flow.
This operator contains one CRD which directs the operator to create/refresh Amazon ECR authorization token in a timely manner:
```yaml
spec:
  ecrRegistry: 288509344804.dkr.ecr.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com
  frequency: 2m
  region: eu-north-1
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/ecr_v1alpha1_ecrtokenrefresh.yaml
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/core.ecr-token-refresh.operators.infra:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/core.ecr-token-refresh.operators.infra:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
